    \begin{abstract}
        This project introduces a flexible landing system based on the April Tag\cite{apriltag3_paper} fiducial system.
        It adds attributes to detected April Tag markers to estimate the pose of landing pads
        under the assumption that they are positioned level on the ground and marked with April Tags,
        and other attributes to enable marker tracking via a gimbal-mounted camera.
        It provides a lightweight April Tag family that allows for marker embedding,
        so that landing pads can be marked with bundles of several large and small markers,
        and allowing the landing pads to be continuously recognized from near and far distances.
        It also addresses the issue of orientation ambiguity in fiducial marker detection
        and its implications in the context of drone control.
